There are generally more valid grades, that is grades of either A, B, or C, being released over time. However, the grades are affected by seasonality as more grades come out in the summer months and less during the winter months. There are increasingly more A grades over time, while the number of C grades peaked in 2013 and has decreased a bit since. B seems about constant, within its cyclical pattern.

The data also allows us to infer the relative number of restaurants amongst the different boroughs, and relative to all of NYC. We can see the Manhattan and Queens have the most restaurants out of the boroughs, while Staten Island has the least. If we pulled the number of unique restaurants in each borough and in all of NYC, we could do a quick calculation that would allow us to measure the relative grade improvement of each region. We could simply take our grade score that was calculated and displayed to the user for each region and divide it by the number of unique restaurants in that region. While this is not the most robust method, it is a quick and easy way to compare different boroughs and all of NYC based on the test_grades function we wrote.

The data is somewhat useful in assessing the quality of restaurants in NYC, but it does not give all of the useful information. While we can see that the nominal number of grades released is increasing over time, and that the nominal number of A grades increases a lot, we don't know the proportion of restaurants in NYC that were graded during this time. For example, the number of grades released for all of NYC seems to double (almost triple) from 2012 to 2015. Obviously the number of restaurants in NYC during this time didn't actually double, but rather, the Health & Food agency had a wider reach over time and was able to regularly assess more restaurants. Thus, if we want to know whether the quality of restaurants in New York City actually improved over time, we'd want to know the proportion of all restaurants that had these various grades rather than the nominal number.
