Question 3.

-I converted the ordered grades by date for a given restaurant into weighted numbers
which takes into account the value of a grade compared to another one. In sequence, 
 I used the numpy diff() function that takes an array and returns an array having
the differences between elements on position array[n+1] and array[n]. Once having
the output (output[n]=array[n+1]-array[n+1]), I calculated the sum of its elements.
If the sum is above 1 I assigned 1, if below 1 I assigned -1, and if neither one
of them I assigned 0.

Question 5.

- The grades of the restaurants are improving over time. Most of the
restaurants seem to have achieved better grades over the past five years.

Question 6.

-It is possible to see that the descend sequence of Borough having more restaurants
graded as "A" is Manhattan > Brooklyn = Queens > Bronx > Staten Island. Also, it
seems that Manhattan has the highest concentration of restaurants among the boroughs,
while Staten Island has the least.
Moreover, there is a more variety of grades being given now. In 2015 grades such as
'A','B','C','P',and 'Z' were given while in 2011 the grades were basically 'A' or 'B'.
I think that the grades can give a reasonable idea in relation to the level of
hygiene observed among restaurants. For example, if a restaurant received an 'A',
there is less chance to ingest any contaminated food from its products. Although,
some restaurants have received an 'A' presenting violations that can lead to 
bad consequences to customers. Therefore, an 'A' is not a stamp of perfection.
On the other hand, the grades do not offer good information on the quality of the
products with regards to taste.
