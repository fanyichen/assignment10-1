Q5: 
Generally the total number of inspected restaurants are incresing. It might be caused by 
the incresing number of restaurants and the increase of inspectations. Also, the number of
GRADE A Restaurants is the largest and increases most rapidly over the time period. The number
of GRADE C restuarants is smallest and does not increase during the time period. It means over all 
the conditions of restaurants in NYC are improving. Also, the number of GRADE A restaurants increased 
most rapidly before mid 2013. The number of GRADE B and C does not change much. These results are similar
between different boroughs.

Q6: 
We can also get the information of the geographical distributions and the cuisine type of the restaurants in
NYC. It is useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in NYC. Because the database is relatively large and 
many of the restaurants have been inspected for more than one time, which makes the score data more reliable. It 
also includes the violation description of the restaurants with details. To conclude, it is a very useful database
to get the information about the quality of restaurants in NYC.
