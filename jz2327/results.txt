Question 5: What conclusion can you draw about the grades? 

Answer here: 

1. In general, the number of restaurants which get grade A is increasing during this period both for NYC or in different boroughs. And the number of restaurants which get grade A is much more than the number of restaurants get other grades.

2. In general, the number of restaurants which get grade A, B or P remains almost same during this period both for NYC or in different boroughs. But recently the number of restaurants which get grade Z is increasing rapidly.

3. Though, for some boroughs like BRONX and STATEN ISLAND, the increasing trend is not apparant while in the rest boroughs the increasing trend is easy to see.

Question 6: What other information can you find out using this data? Is the data useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in New York City?

Other Information:

1. While the number of restaurants which get grade A is increasing, the number does have some seasonal patterns: from March to September the number is high while from September to next year's March the number is relatively low.

2. It may be infered that the grading policy may be more strict than before since the number of restaurants which get grade Z is increasing rapidly recently.

I think the data is useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in New York City:
Reason 1: the increase of the number of restaurants which get grade A shows the quality is improving.
Reason 2: the data indicates a more strict grading policy makes the grade more reliable.
