Question 5: What conclusion can you draw about the grades? 

Answer here: 

1. In general, the number of restaurants which get grade A is increasing during this period both for NYC or in different boroughs. And the number of restaurants which get grade A is much more than the number of restaurants which get other grades.

2. In general, the number of restaurants which get grade B, C remains almost same during this period both for NYC or in different boroughs. 

3. Though, for some boroughs like BRONX and STATEN ISLAND, the increasing trend is not apparant while in the rest boroughs the increasing trend is easy to see.

Question 6: What other information can you find out using this data? Is the data useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in New York City?

Other Information:

1. While the number of restaurants which get grade A is increasing, the number does have some seasonal patterns: from March to September the number is high while from September to next year's March the number is relatively low.

2. The number of restaurants in Manhattan is the largest while Staten island has the least restaurants. It may suggest that the population in Manhattan is the largest.

I think the data is useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in New York City because the increase of the number of restaurants which get grade A shows the quality is improving. Also the seasonal pattern shown in the plots demonstrates the fluctuation of the quality of restaurants in one year.
