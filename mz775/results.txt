Question 5

From the graphs I found that grades of restaurants in NYC and its boroughs have been improving from 2011 to 2015.
We can see that the number of restaurants with grade A has been increasing. Although there is a slight drop of this
quantity from 2014 to 2015 for some areas, overall we can observe upward trends in all graphes.
At the same time, the number of restaurants with grade C has been decreasing over time, and the number of restaurants
with grade B have been relatively stable.
I think this suggests a good sign on improvement of restaurants' quality in the city.


Question 6

I think this data set is useful in assessing the qualities of restaurants in NYC. This data set includes other useful
information such as cuisine, zipcode, and violation description. We can use those information to find common problems
of restaurants in the same area. Also we can find best areas for different cuisines. For example, we can find areas with
best Italian food by finding the zipcode with most grade A Italian restaurants.
