1. We can conclude that over the years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, there is a general
increase in number of restaurants receiving an A grade. We can see this in the
grade_improvement_nyc graph, which includes data for all five boroughs. The only
borough in which we don't see a steady increase in A grades is Staten Island. 
However, this could also be due to restaurants having not been graded yet, or 
their data being missing from the dataframe. 

2. Using this data we could investigate a potential correlation between restaurant
location and inspection grade, to see if there is any difference in the quality of
restaurants or a difference in the inspectors giving the grades in each of the
boroughs. We could also look at the type of cuisine, and if that has an effect 
on the grade of the restaurant. For example, we may see less bakeries receiving a
low score, because they aren't generally dealing with meat and other food items
that require special attention. In addition, there are likely areas within each
borough that have a higher number of A-grade restaurants or C-grade restaurants.
We could investigate this using the zipcode column, and see if zipcode has an effect
on inspection grade.

3. I don't believe this data is a useful source for assessing the quality of 
restaurants because there is ambiguity in the meaning of an inspection grade. 
We don't know exactly what the inspection process is, and if it varies over the 
different areas of New York City. Also, an inspection grade of 'A' does not 
imply that a restaurant is a 'good' restaurant, it only implies that it is
in compliance with the restaurant requirements of New York (whatever they may be).
