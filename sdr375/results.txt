2) For all boroughs, The number of A's increase over the years, with the exception of staten island

Other information we can obtain from this dataset:

1) We have data available on the violation. Hence we can map out the infractions to find out "zones" where a certain infraction is common and take action to resolve this issue in the specific zones.

2) We can find patterns in types of violations among a certain chain of restaurants, or a restaurant type. This could aid investigation into brand evaluation and estimating brand quality.
