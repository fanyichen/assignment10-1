Question 5
From the plots we see that all the grades are growing over the last years. 
That could just mean that over time there are more and more restaurants that are graded. 
We can also notice that the number of A increases much more than the number of the other grades. 
That could mean that the quality of the restaurant is improving.

Question 6
Other information could be retrieved from this dataset. 
For example the same analysis we did with the granularity of the boro could be done using the zip code.
Or other kind of analysis could be done using other fields in the data set, such as the VIOLATION DESCRIPTION. 
It could be interesting to understand which kind of violation are more common in anyone of the boros.
