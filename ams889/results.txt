Question 5:
From our graphs it appears as though more A's are awarded as time passes while the number of B's and C's remains relatively stable.
This would suggest that grades are getting better or simply more restaurants are getting rated with A's rather than the restaurants rated in the past
getting improved scores. Perhaps the guidelines have changed and it is easier to get an A. From the sum of the borough scores it would actually appear
that restaurants are actually getting worse (they were all negative). 

Question 6:
The additional information not related to inspection grades is information about the restaurants along the lines of name, phone number, cuisine and a few other fields.
In terms of 'quality' we don't get any details about the quality of the food, only the inspection scores a restaurant received and the violations associated with them.
If we were interested in the scores across New York City we definitely have some data that can help, but it doesn't feel like this dataset is a comprehensive set of
all scores for all restaurants in NYC, so we only have a subset. Therefore, perhaps we won't have a full picture of the inspection scores across NYC, and our view will
be skewed. Not to mention, often a restaurant will have several inspections within a short span of time if they are found to have violations that need improvement, and
our data may be dominated by these types of restaurants.
