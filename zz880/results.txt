Question 5:
From the graphs, we can observe that in all the boroughs, most restaurants maintained same grades from 2010 to 2015,
and the there are more declined restaurants than improved restaurants. Manhattan has most restaurants and State Island
has least restaurants.

Question 6:
In this analysis, we only used the grades of each restaurants which have only three levels "A", "B" and "C". The reason
why most restaurants stayed the same is majority of restaurants have grade "A" in the beginning of this period and there
is no room for them to improve. There is also a score field in the dataset which provided more detailed information and
we can use the score to obtain a more precision report.
