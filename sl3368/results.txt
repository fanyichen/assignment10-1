Question 5:

Based on the plots generated by the function, we can see that the grades of restaurants have been keep improving from 2011 to 2015. Although each of my plot looks flexible since I grouped grades by date, when we add each grade date together and take a look at each year's sum grades, we can find this upward trend.
 
Conclusion: The number of restaurants with grade A is increasing, while the number of restaurants with grade B and C does not change much and is relatively stable. Meanwhile, the proportion of restaurants with grade B and C is much more less than grade A, and this means that most of the restaurants are in good condition.

Therefore, according to these graphs, we can say that the quality of the restaurants in NYC(including all five Boroughs) is improving over time.


Question 6:

From this data, we can also find out some other information, such as restaurants' location, cuisine, and also violation description. This data is useful for assessing the quality of restaurants in NYC, because by using these information, we can find out which restaurant has the least number of violation. Moreover, we can also know which area has more number of good restaurants by combining locations and grades. If you want to further analyze this data, you could also find out what kind of cuisine is more popular.
