First, this dataset is really big since it contains over 40,0000 data. We can use feature \'93BORO\'94 to get restaurant distribution of particular area. Based on this, people can see that many restaurants have been inspected more than one time so that it can give a reliable list. The \'93CUISINE\'94 is giving interesting information since the distribution of the cuisine in different area could tell us that people prefer what kind of restaurants in that area. According to this information, some business starters could pick an appropriate cuisine in the area where they want to open a new business.}
