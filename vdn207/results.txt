Analysis of the grades of NYC over years
----------------------------------------

Over the years, a lot of restaurants have been evaluated. In 2011, very few restaurants were evaluated. But, gradually, till 2015,
the number of restaurants graded has increased. Most of the restuarants graded have got an A grade, some have B grade and few C grade.

But, from 2014 to 2015, there is a small difference in the number of restuarants across all the grades.

Possibile explorations from data
--------------------------------
-> We can classify the different cuisine types and find which ones have been graded best and worst over time.
-> We can analyze the violation description and find out the primitive mistakes. This helps in understanding the rules that are being hugely violated or taken less seriously. 

The data has enough restaurants to address the quality of the restaurants. And, the fact that the data is available over 5 years gives a good backing to carry out quality analysis.
