Question 5:
We can see that in the entire city of New York the amount of A grades to restaurants have increased through the years.
The number of B and C grades presented an increment until the year 2013, then they were the same and after 2014
started to decrease.
We can see that the number of A grades is considerable higher to the other grades. Which make sense, due mostly all the
restaurants would try to get the highest grade in order to not affect their reputation.
We can see that all boroughs follow the same pattern. However, Staten Island is the only borough that present a decrease
in A grades in the last year.

Question 6:
We can see that picking any restaurant in NYC, will result in a high probability of it having an A grade.
I think we can get also more insight if we get the number of restaurants per year, and the quantity of grades.
(We have to take in consideration that new restaurants open every year). This could allow us to see how the ratio of
grades moves through the years.
Now talking about the scores, it would be a good idea to normalize them. Its obvious that Manhattan has a bigger
score due it has a larger amount of restaurants than any other boroughs. That would allow us to assess better the
quality of the restaurants in NYC in general and in every borough.
